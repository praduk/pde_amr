\section{Equation of State}

\begin{df}[The Equation of State]
Static pressure, density and temperature are related by the
\emph{equation of state} $\mathfrak{p}:\R^{n+1}\to \R$ for $n$
species of gas.
\begin{equation}
    p(t,r) = \mathfrak{p}(\rho_0(t,r), \rho_1(t,r), \ldots \rho_{n-1}(t,r), T(t,r)).
\end{equation}
\end{df}

\begin{df}[Dalton's Law of Parital Pressures]
If the equation of state for a uniform species of gas is
$\mathfrak{p}_i:\R^{n+1}\to \R$, then the equation of
state for a mixture of gasses is
\begin{equation}
    \mathfrak{p}(\rho_0(t,r), \rho_1(t,r), \ldots \rho_{n-1}(t,r), T(t,r)) =
        \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \mathfrak{p}(\rho_i(t,r),T(t,r)).
\end{equation}
\end{df}

\begin{df}[Ideal Gas Law]
The equation of state for an \emph{ideal gas} is
\begin{equation}
    \mathfrak{p}_i(\rho_i,T_i) = \rho_i R_i T_i
\end{equation}
where $R_i\in \R$ is the constant given by
\begin{equation}
    R_i = \frac{\bar{R}}{M_i}
\end{equation}
where $\bar{R}\in \R$ is the ideal gas constant
and $M_i\in \R$ is the molecular weight of the gas.
\end{df}
\begin{rk}
The ideal gas constant is $\bar{R}=8.314459848$ J/kg/$^\circ$K
and for air $R\approx 2817$ J/kg/$^\circ$K.
\end{rk}
